# Penetration Testing 
Scenario 
Based upon your previous work with your client, they have asked you to perform a formal penetration. 
test of a new server. The salient points of your contract are as follows: 

Scope of work:  
The penetration test will be performed during normal business hours. Two 
weeks are allocated for the assessment concluding with a presentation to client management. 
and submission of a formal written report due at the end of that period. A dedicated 
workstation located within the client network will be provided for the penetration tester to 
perform their assessment. This will be a “black box” scenario, whereby the penetration tester. 
will not be given any foreknowledge of the server being tested.

Rules of engagement:   
The only machine the penetration tester is authorized to scan and exploit 
is the new accounting server. No other machines in the network are to be scanned. Any 
information found during the penetration test is to be considered proprietary property of the 
client and may not be disclosed to any individuals except the client-designated contact person 
for this assessment. 

Project Tasks 
By successfully completing this project, you will have demonstrated your ability to perform a 
penetration test and write a formal report. 

Project Tasks are as follows:  
1. Download and install the new accounting server into the Trusted network. 
2. Enumerate and research the vulnerabilities of the new server. 
3. Exploit the vulnerabilities of the new server. 
4. Write a 3-page report on the penetration test. The report should include: 
a) Executive summary 
b) Methodologies 
c) Vulnerabilities found 
d) Exploits achieved 
e) Recommended mitigations and remediations
